# Weather-Journal App Project

As part of Udacity's Front End Developer Nano-Degree Certification Program, this project is designed to teach the fundamentals of fetching data from an API.

# Install Node Modules

# Create an .env file in the root folder

Once you create an account, you can create an .env file on the root folder and add your API_KEY there.

```bash
API_KEY = '<API_KEY>&units=imperial'
```

# Run the server

```bash
npm run start
```
